<h3><strong>Puppy Hero</strong> is a site to help new and current responsible Animal Lovers find dog and puppy <strong>Rescues</strong> in their immediate area to adopt or foster.</h3>
<h3><strong>We are here for Shelters.</strong></h3>
Shelters can easily upload photos and create simple searchable profiles for ALL their pups needing a new home. Our service is of course free.
<h3><strong>We are here to Connect.</strong></h3>
We know just how important Human to Human connections are and as Animal Lovers we all know the incredible bonds we have made with Mans Best Friend. If you are in need of some love... Rescue a Puppy, Be a Hero.
<h3><strong>We are here to Disrupt.</strong></h3>
We aim to disrupt the corporate sales of Puppies and thousand of backyard puppy mills plaguing this country coast to coast by acting as a community awareness project and advocate for dogs and puppies that are tragically over looked.  We provide a free service for anyone searching for a lifetime companion, an orphaned pup with unconditional love for it's Human.
<h3><strong>We are Open Source.</strong></h3>
Puppy Hero IS and Open Source project on Github so anyone can contribute to code development, design and it's over all functionality.
<h3><strong>We are Self-Funded</strong></h3>
So if you can't share a like tweet or code...we accept Bitcoin, Ethereum and of course <em>DogeCoin</em>
