Rescue a Puppy, Be a Hero!

Scope:
   Saving Dogs: App allows animal shelters to snap a photo of their rescues (with geotags) to upload to a searchable app. End-users can search for rescues to adopt by State, County, Zip Code. This is an effort to disrupt corporate sales of dogs in puppy mills and rival such apps like PetFinder (a for-profit internet company owned by Nestle'). The PUPPY HERO app gives responsible pet owners access to puppies facing the worst fate. The solution is simple but the goal will be hard.
   
Funding: Raising it the hard way and asking for donations via crypto and yes, of course we will be accepting DOGECoin.
