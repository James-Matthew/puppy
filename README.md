Rescue a Puppy, Be a Hero!

Scope:
   Saving Dogs: Allows Kill shelters to snap a photo of there rescues (with geotags) to upload to a searchable app. End users can search for rescues by State, County, Zip Code. This is an effort to distrupt and rival corporate sales of dogs in puppie mills and rival such apps like PetFinder. The app gives our users access to puppies facing the worst fate. The solution is simple but the goal will be hard.
